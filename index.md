### ELASTICSEARCH

Elasticsearch is the living heart of what is today’s the most popular log analytics platform — the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana). Elasticsearch’s role is so central that it has become synonymous with the name of the stack itself. Primarily for search and log analysis, Elasticsearch is today one of the most popular database systems available today. This Elasticsearch tutorial provides new users with the prerequisite knowledge and tools to start using Elasticsearch. It includes installation instructions, and initial indexing and data handling instructions.

Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine based on Apache Lucene. Since its release in 2010, Elasticsearch has quickly become the most popular search engine, widely used for log analysis, full-text search, security intelligence, business analytics, and operational intelligence.


### How does Elasticsearch work?


You can send data to Elasticsearch in the form of JSON documents using the API or ingestion tools such as Logstash and Amazon Kinesis Firehose . Elasticsearch automatically saves the original document and inserts a searchable reference to the document into the cluster's index. You can then search and retrieve the document using the Elasticsearch API. You can also use Elasticsearch with the visualization tool Kibana to visualize your data and create interactive dashboards.
You can run Apache 2.0 licensed Elasticsearch versions (up to version 7.10.2 and Kibana 7.10.2) locally, on Amazon EC2, or on the Amazon OpenSearch Service. For on-premises or Amazon EC2 deployments, you are responsible for installing Elasticsearch and other required software, provisioning the infrastructure, and managing the cluster. Amazon OpenSearch Service, on the other hand, is a fully managed service, so you don't have to worry about time-consuming cluster management tasks like hardware provisioning, software patching, error recovery, backups, and monitoring.

Elasticsearch advantages
FASTER VALUE CREATION
Elasticsearch offers simple REST-based APIs, a simple HTTP interface, and uses schema-free JSON documents, making it easy to get started and quickly build applications for a variety of use cases.
